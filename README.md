## Work Experience
**Free Lance Data Science Consultant @AdlerInsights, Giessen-Germany (_January 2025 - Present_)**
### Featured Projects:
* What promotional method improves Sales? (Kaggle)
_Utilized pandas to explore and clean the dataset, deployed seaborn and matplotlib to visualize descriptive statistics and to guide the selection of predictor variables, utilized statsmodels to model and fit a multiple linear regression to the data, interpreted the model outputs and summarized results for technical and non-technical stakeholders respectively._

### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)


Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
